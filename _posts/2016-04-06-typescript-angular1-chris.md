Recently I had a great opportunity to sit down with brilliant and humble friend Chris Martin to film a Play by Play video for Pluralsight. Chris had an Angular 1 app he had written in ES5 and wanted to convert it to TypeScript. We decided to try the conversation live while filming (what could go wrong?!). The keys for us were to tackle it in a methodical way such that we could see it running as we did the conversion and to have transpilation, linting and tooling help along the way. [You can watch us on this venture as we had a lot of fun exploring how to tackle this conversion.](http://jpapa.me/a1tspbp)

Here is the description of the video with me and Chris ...

>[In this video](http://jpapa.me/a1tspbp), Play by Play: Angular with Typescript with John Papa and Christopher Martin, master Node and JavaScript developer Chris Martin sits down with John Papa as they walk through converting an Angular application written in ECMAScript 5 to TypeScript. Chris will set up TypeScript tooling and learn as he explores the benefits of migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript, including Static Type-checking, better tooling, and the ability to detect and fix issues early. Through this course, you'll see the various ways of working with Angular concepts in TypeScript, including modules, services, controllers, and directives, as well as helpful tools TypeScript provides for writing better code and detecting errors. You'll learn the pros and cons of using TypeScript functions and classes for writing your Angular code. Please join us on this journey through building an Angular 1 Web application with TypeScript. By the time you're done, you'll not only understand a lot more about Angular with Typescript, but you'll also know how to problem-solve like a pro.
