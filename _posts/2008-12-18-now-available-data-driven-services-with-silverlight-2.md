This should be up before the end of the year. If code samples need to be updated at some point, I will make adjustments online. Of course, code samples will be available from <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a>&#160; and from O’Reilly’s site, too.</p>  <p>For now, you can find the code samples for the book in my&#160; l<img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="180" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/NowAvailableDataDrivenServiceswithSilver_C7C9/image_8.png" width="260" align="right" border="0" />inks section. Just go to <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> and scroll down on the right hand site and look for “Links”.
