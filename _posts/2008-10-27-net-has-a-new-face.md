<p>There is a fresh new look to the .NET logo. Its got a little bit of <a href="/tags/silverlight/">Silverlight</a>-iness and retains the Visual Studio logo similarities. Overall it is a nice new look.</p>  <p><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="94" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/b441c98e8027.NETHasaNewFace_7F63/image_3.png" width="260" border="0" /></p>
