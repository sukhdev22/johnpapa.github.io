<p>A few weeks ago I had a great time talking with Carl and Richard about the client development landscape. We chatted about everything from XAML, to Windows Phone, Windows 8, to Silverlight, to HTML5, to JavaScript, to KnockoutJS, to and JsRender. <a href="http://bitly.com/dnr730jp">That discussion ended up being on this week’s DotNetRocks episode #730.</a></p> <p>I’m finding that the client landscape is an extremely interesting area with a lot of exciting new activity. Between hardware solutions and some great technologies running on them, it’s a great time to dive into them and see what floats, and more importantly, get inspired to create. This is one of the reasons I decided to start writing a new column in MSDN Magazine (soon to be formally announced) on the client landscape and where I can explore an array of client tech.</p> <p>You can check out <a href="http://bitly.com/dnr730jp">the entire lively discussion on DotNetRocks with Carl, Richard and me right here</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://bitly.com/dnr730jp"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Discussing-the-Microsoft-Client-Landscap_B2FA/image_3.png" width="870" height="140"></a></p>
