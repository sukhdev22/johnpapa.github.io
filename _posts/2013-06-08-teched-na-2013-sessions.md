Here are the KnockoutJS and SPA presentations I gave at Tech Ed NA 2013 conference in New Orleans in June. Thank you to all who attended … I had a great time and really enjoyed the questions after the session. The deck, abstract and samples are in this post.

<h3>Knockout</h3>
Watch the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/DEV-B338" target="_blank">KnockoutJS and MVVM: Tips for Building HTML and JavaScript Web Apps</a> here.

<blockquote>Do you write a lot of HTML and JavaScript code to push and pull data? In this session, learn popular techniques to use data binding to bind your data to your target controls in HTML writing less code, but gaining more power. See how to consume JSON data, use JSON objects in JavaScript, use declarative binding, using KnockoutJS. Also, see how to use the MVVM pattern to write data-centric Javascript code that follows good separation patterns and creates highly maintainable code.

<h3>Single Page Apps</h3>
Watch the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/DEV-B350" target="_blank">Single Page Applications with Microsoft ASP.NET</a> here.

<blockquote>Interested in learning more about building Single Page Apps (SPA)? SPAs focus on delivering better user experiences with significant client-side interactions using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. Now you can get started with SPA using the ASP.NET SPA Template. This session explores the core pieces that help you build end-to-end SPA solutions including code structure and modularity, using data binding and MVVM, abstracted remote data calls, page navigation and routing, rich data features, and responsive design for mobility. Along the way, we touch on popular libraries such as Knockout, Sammy, and Breeze.

<h3>Learn More SPA</h3>
If you enjoyed my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spajsps" target="_blank">Single Page Application Jump-Start course</a>, you will be happy to learn that the <a href="http://jpapa.me/ccjshtcode" target="_blank">source code for the final SPA Jump-Start solution is now available</a>! The great folks at Pluralsight worked with me to host the final solution of Code Camper Jump-Start (CCJS) on GitHub. You can grab the code, fork it, make pull requests, or just browse!
