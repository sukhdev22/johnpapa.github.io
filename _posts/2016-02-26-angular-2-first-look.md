My [Angular 2 First Look course is now available on Pluralsight](http://jpapa.me/a2ps1stlook).

This course is a gentle introduction to the changes that Angular 2 brings, how they compare to Angular 1, and provides an understanding of the architecture and how the core concepts work together to build applications.

You will learn how your Angular 1 skills translate and prepare you to build Angular 2 applications. Code samples focus on specific features including Angular 2 components, templates directives, data binding syntax, modules, dependency injection, routing, HTTP, pipes, and services.

All samples are written in TypeScript and run live on the web where you can see and edit them with a click of a button; no setup required. We launch the demos directly to plunker.

Some of the topics this course covers are Components, Templates, Metadata, Pipes, Data Binding, Template Syntax, Built-In Directives, Dependency Injection, Lifecycle Hooks, Routing, Http , and Services.

This course is a first look at Angular 2. And as such, it slides nicely in as a precursor te forthcoming Getting Stated and Fundamentals courses.

I hope you enjoy it!
