Looking for an easy way to kick-start your <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a> app development in under a minute? Now you can with <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/hottowel.angular" target="_blank">HotTowel.Angular, a free NuGet package</a> (and soon to become a Bower package too). What do you get? Let's take a look ...

<h3>What's Inside?</h3>
There are a few libraries out of the box that come with HotTowel.Angular. Of course Angular is in here, but there are a few others I bundled into this package as they work very well together and I find myself wanting them in most apps. They help add a bit of style, theming, and helpers.
<ul>
<li>Angular core library</li>
<li>Angular's routing module</li>
<li>Angular's animation module</li>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap for layout</li>
<li>FontAwesome icons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Kick-Start</h3>
Adding some libraries is a convenience, but one of the first things that helps me get going with an app is to get the basic structure laid out. So I included what I have found to be most helpful in kick-starting my apps. I think you'll find that this code will help you get out of the gate quickly and you can customize it any way you like. Here is a glimpse of just some of what you will find. You can learn more about the <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-growth-structure/" target="_blank">structure of the app by reading this post</a>.
<ul>
<li>Responsive Design with Custom CSS</li>
<li>Dashboard Structure</li>
<li>Multiple Views and Menu Structure</li>
<li>Spinner</li>
<li>Logging</li>
<li>Splash Page</li>
<li>Alerts via <a href="http://toastrjs.com" target="_blank">Toastr</a></li>
<li>Structured Code</li>
</ul>

<h3>Easy Peasy</h3>
It's super simple to install HotTowel.Angular. Use the NuGet Package Manager Console and go!
<pre class="prettyprint">
Install-Package HotTowel.Angular
</pre>

I hope you all enjoy HotTowel.Angular!
