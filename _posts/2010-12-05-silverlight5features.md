We spent much of the past 5 months working up to this event from what started as a (very messy) diagram on my whiteboard … most of which is still up there. We built a team from many parts of the company to handle the aspects of the event and on Dec 2 we delivered what became the Silverlight Firestarter 2010. I had the honor of playing many roles in the event and I am blown away by the overwhelming support we received inside and outside of Microsoft.</p>  <p>But this post is all about the features, so let’s first start with the features we announced:</p>  <h3><strong>Premium Media Experiences</strong></h3>  <p>Silverlight 5 offers improved media support and rich UI capabilities:</p>  <ul>   <li>Hardware Decode and presentation of H.264 improve performance for lower-power devices to render high-definition video using GPU support.</li>    <li>TrickPlay allows video to be played at different speeds and supports fast-forward and rewind. At up to twice the speed, audio pitch correction allows users to watch videos while preserving a normal audio pitch.</li>    <li>Improved power awareness prevents the screen saver from being shown while watching video and allows the computer to sleep when video is not active.</li>    <li>Remote-control support allows users to control media playback.</li>    <li>Digital rights management advancements allow seamless switching between DRM media sources.</li> </ul>  <p><b></b></p>  <h3><b>Business Application Development</b></h3>  <ul>   <li>Fluid user interface enables smoother animation within the UI. Inter-Layout Transitions allow developers to specify animations to apply when elements are added, removed or re-ordered within a layout. This provides smoother user experiences when, for example, items are inserted into a list.</li>    <li>Text improvements make it possible to build rich magazine-style text layouts:</li>    <ul>     <li>Multicolumn text and linked text container allow text to flow around other elements.</li>      <li>Tracking/leading set precisely how far apart each character is for full creative control.</li>      <li>Text clarity is improved with Pixel Snapping.</li>      <li>Text layout performance is significantly improved.</li>      <li>OpenType support has been enhanced.</li>   </ul>    <li>Support for Postscript vector printing enables users to create reports and documents, including the ability to create a virtual print view different from what is shown on the screen.</li>    <li>Applications can now work the way users expect with added support for double-click and Combobox type ahead.</li>    <li>Model View ViewModel (MVVM) and Databinding enhancements allow more work to be done more easily via XAML:</li>    <ul>     <li>Debugging support now allows breakpoints to be set on a binding, so you can step through binding failures.</li>      <li>Implicit DataTemplates allow templates to be created across an application to support a particular type by default.</li>      <li>Ancestor RelativeSource allows, for example, a DataTemplate to bind to a property on the control that contains it.</li>      <li>Binding in style setters allows bindings to be used within styles to reference other properties.</li>      <li>The DataContextChanged event is being introduced. Markup extensions allow code to be run at XAML parse time for both properties and event handlers, enabling cutting-edge MVVM support. </li>   </ul>    <li>Networking and Windows Communication Foundation enhancements:</li>    <ul>     <li>Reduced network latency by using a background thread for networking.</li>      <li>WS-Trust support: message security — encrypted at the Windows Communication Foundation level; Security Assertion Markup Language authentication token.</li>   </ul>    <li>Silverlight 5 performance improvements include these: </li>    <ul>     <li>Reduced network latency by using a background thread for networking.</li>      <li>XAML parser improvements that speed up startup and runtime performance.</li>      <li>Support for 64-bit operating systems.</li>   </ul>    <li>Graphics improvements</li>    <ul>     <li>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated 3-D application programming interface (API) provides rich graphics on the Web for building advanced data visualizations and rich user experience (UI).</li>      <li>Immediate mode graphics API allows direct rendering to the GPU.</li>      <li>Hardware acceleration is enabled in windowless mode with Internet Explorer 9.</li>   </ul>    <li>Silverlight offers a new class of trusted applications that brings desktop capabilities to the browser for the first time. These features, when enabled via a group policy registry key and an application certificate, mean users won’t need to leave the browser to perform complex tasks:</li>    <ul>     <li>Host HTML content as a Web browser control within the Silverlight application. HTML pages, such as help content or e-mail, can be integrated within the application.</li>      <li>Read and write files to the user’s My Documents folder, making it easier to find media files or create local copies of reports. </li>      <li>Launch Microsoft Office and other desktop programs. Users can open Microsoft Outlook and create an e-mail message, or send a report to Word utilizing the power of Office. </li>      <li> Access devices and other system capabilities by calling into application COM components. Users can access a USB security card reader or a bar-code scanner.</li>      <li>Enjoy full keyboard support in full screen, which enables richer kiosk and media viewing applications.</li>      <li>Call existing unmanaged code directly from within Silverlight with PInvoke.</li>   </ul>    <li>Out-of-browser trusted applications are further enhanced:</li>    <ul>     <li>Existing unmanaged code can be called directly from within Silverlight with PInvoke.</li>      <li>Child Window support allows multiple windows to be launched from the application.</li>   </ul>    <li>Tools improvements include these:</li>    <ul>     <li>Microsoft Visual Studio profiling support including CPU, memory, thread contention.</li>      <li>Visual Studio Team Test support.</li>   </ul> </ul>
