<p>This Summer and Fall with the help of <a href="http://ineta.org">INETA</a> I am touring around a bit to several conferences&#160; and user groups. I have a few events still in the works that I will announce a<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Silverlight2atNaples.NetUserGroup_B8EF/image_4.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="160" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Silverlight2atNaples.NetUserGroup_B8EF/image_thumb_1.png" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>s (or if) they firm up. One event that just got finalized is a trip to the <a href="http://www.naplesdot.net/">Naples .NET User Group</a>. The web site is now promoting the Southwest Florida Code Camp they are hosting in Sep on Saturday the 13th. Ever since I moved to Florida I have noticed that all of the user groups I have been to are all full of a bunch of very active and exceptionally passionate developers. I am sure this new code camp they are hosting will be awesome.</p>  <p>I will be presenting at the Naples .NET User group on November 18th. The topic will be Data Services with Silverlight 2 If you are in the area, please stop by and say hi! . Here is a synopsis of the session. </p>  <p><font color="#0080ff">Silverlight 2 enables developers to use their .NET and XAML skills to develop Rich Internet Applications and to build data driven Silverlight applications that communicate with multi-tier architectures. This session will show how to build Silverlight 2 applications that communicate with and consume ASMX Web Services, WCF services, REST services and use LINQ to XML to manage XML content, show the various data binding techniques, and show how to use WCF to talk to various middle tier services including custom entity models.</font></p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/silverlight-2-at-naples-net-user-group/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/silverlight-2-at-naples-net-user-group/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/silverlight-2-at-naples-net-user-group/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'Silverlight 2 at Naples .Net User Group';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'Silverlight 2 at Naples .Net User Group';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '1';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
