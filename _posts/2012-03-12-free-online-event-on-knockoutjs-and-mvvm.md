<p>I published my <a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm">Knockout / JavaScript / MVVM course with Pluralsight</a> last month and have been getting a lot of positive feedback … <strong>thanks</strong>! I decided to do a free short presentation from the course and answer some questions online. And what better way to do that than on LIDNUG. So next Monday I’ll be presenting KnockoutJs and MVVM at LIDNUG …&nbsp; y<a href="http://lidnug-johnpapa2.eventbrite.com/">ou can register for the event online</a>. Monday, March 19th 2012 from 1:00pm to 2:00pm ET</p> <p><strong>HTML/ JavaScript Apps with MVVM and KnockoutJS</strong></p> <blockquote>Do you write a lot of HTML and JavaScript code to push and pull data? In this session John will demonstrate how to bind your data from JavaScript to your target controls in HTML writing less code, and gaining more power. See how to use objects in JavaScript, use declarative binding, integrate templates and control of flow, create custom bindings, and include jQuery UI following good separation patterns using KnockoutJS and MVVM.</blockquote> <p>&nbsp; <p><a href="http://lidnug-johnpapa2.eventbrite.com/"><img alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/e58a68b47406_CA7C/image_thumb_2.png" width="1024" height="593"></a>
