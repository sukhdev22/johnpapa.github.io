<p>Here is the mock up of my upcoming Silverlight 2 book that <a href="/all/as-it-once-was-i-am-writing-a-book/">I mentioned earlier today</a>. The title is still up in the air, as is the cover art, and ... let's face it ...&nbsp; just about everything except for the release date of Nov/Dec 2008.&nbsp; I just wanted to see what it might look like so I mocked up a fake book cover to the amusement of myself and my daughters. Though I think they want a cat or an eagle on the cover :-)</p> <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Silverlight2BookCoverMockUp_D252/book2_2.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="484" alt="Data Access with Silverlight 2" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/Silverlight2BookCoverMockUp_D252/book2_thumb.png" width="369" border="0"></a></p>
