David discusses the types of multi-touch hardware and his experiences in developing real world multi-touch applications. Then he jumps right into the code and shows how to create a multi-touch application with Silverlight 3 or 4! The application David demonstrates walks through the key multi-touch events, handling those events, touch IDs, tracking the location of the touch points, and much more. </p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong><font color="#ff0000">UPDATE</font></strong></p>    <p>Here are some useful links that David provided: </p>    <ul>     <li>here is a quick post to the SL3 code we used from Tim Heuer </li>      <ul>       <li><a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/07/30/silverlight-3-multi-touch-introduction-fundamentals-basics.aspx">http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/07/30/silverlight-3-multi-touch-introduction-fundamentals-basics.aspx</a></li>     </ul>      <li>this code converts easily to SL4 also here is a quick post more about the UX concepts used in multitouch</li>      <ul>       <li><a href="http://hackingsilverlight.blogspot.com/2010/01/silverlight-multi-touch-in-real-world.html">http://hackingsilverlight.blogspot.com/2010/01/silverlight-multi-touch-in-real-world.html</a></li>     </ul>      <li>also the simon demo that includes multitouch (will have an SL4 version at MIX) that Davide Zordan and I worked on.</li>      <ul>       <li><a href="http://simon.codeplex.com/">http://simon.codeplex.com/</a></li>     </ul>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And remember that you can subscribe to Silverlight TV several ways:</p>  <ul>   <ul>     <li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/SilverlightTV/RSS/">Subscribe to the RSS feed for the show itself</a> </li>      <li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/SilverlightTV/feed/zune/">Subscribe to the show on your Zune</a> </li>      <li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/SilverlightTV/feed/ipod/">Subscribe to the show for your iPod</a> </li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>If you have not watched the previous episodes of Silverlight TV, you can catch them here. </p>  <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/SilverlightTV/Silverlight-TV-Episode-2-Perspectives-on-Flash-and-Silverlight/"><strong>Episode 2: Perspectives on Flash and Silverlight</strong></a></p>  <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/SilverlightTV/Silverlight-TV-Episode-2-Perspectives-on-Flash-and-Silverlight/"><img title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightTVEpisode2PerspectivesonFlash_9DAF/image_3.png" width="255" height="151" /></a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/SilverlightTV/Out-of-Browser-in-Silverlight-4-Silverlight-TV-Episode-1/"><strong>Episode 1: The Joys of Trusted Out-of-Browser Applications in Silverlight 4</strong></a></p>  <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/SilverlightTV/Out-of-Browser-in-Silverlight-4-Silverlight-TV-Episode-1/"><img title="clip_image001" border="0" alt="clip_image001" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/7f977e907c4d_EE29/clip_image001_64b0d373-2931-4a04-8ed9-d0ed32699463.jpg" width="256" height="146" /></a></p>
