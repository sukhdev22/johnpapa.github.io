<p>Fay is on the move and its heading right towards my area. We’ve locked up tight and prepared even though it will probably all be just fine. Its probably going to be a Cat 1 at worst, let’s hope. I’ve been through a few bigger storms than this, once in Florida and we’ve prepared pretty well. </p>  <p><a href="http://7papa7.com/FloridaLife/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TropicalStormFay_1419F/tropicalstormfay_2.jpg"><img title="tropicalstormfay" height="199" alt="tropicalstormfay" src="http://7papa7.com/FloridaLife/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TropicalStormFay_1419F/tropicalstormfay_thumb.jpg" width="293" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>My wife is <a href="/FloridaLife/blog/tropical-storm-fay/">thrilled that we have a generator</a> ready to go just in case. Can’t say I blame her. Its nice to have the basics available to you. My wife has been tracking the progress closely and posted some of her thoughts on her blog site. Yep, my wife is blogging now. She is pretty good at it too … better than me!</p>  <p>Her site is called “<a href="/FloridaLife/">Colleen’s World</a>: You just live in it!”. Nice huh :) You can find it <a href="/FloridaLife/">here</a>.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TheStormisComing_FE2B/image_2.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="41" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TheStormisComing_FE2B/image_thumb.png" width="196" border="0" /></a></p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/the-storm-is-coming/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/the-storm-is-coming/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript"><!-- var dzone_url = '/all/the-storm-is-coming/'; var dzone_title = 'The Storm is Coming'; var dzone_blurb = 'The Storm is Coming'; var dzone_style = '1'; --></script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
