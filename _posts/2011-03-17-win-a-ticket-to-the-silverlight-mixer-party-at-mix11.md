<p>Each week for the next 4 weeks I will be giving away 1 free ticket to the 3rd annual Silverlight MIXer party held in the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas during MIX11. This Silverlight MIXer is an invite only party that I host each year where Silverlight and Windows Phone influencers gather to talk, eat, drink, and have fun. We have also been known to give away some <strong>very </strong>cool prizes! This year&rsquo;s party is 6-9 on April 13th at MIX11. Only a valid pass will get you in!</p>

<p>Due to limited budget and fire codes <img src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/Win-a-Ticket-to-the-Silverlight-MIXer-Pa_1405C/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" /> invitations are always hot for this party. This year I&rsquo;ve decided to offer 4 free tickets, 1 per week, via a contest on my blog. So if you are interested in attending, here is your chance!</p>
<p>To enter this week&rsquo;s contest you must leave a comment with your twitter ID on this post (so I can contact and announce the winner) with the correct answer. All correct answers by the given deadline (using Pacific Time in the USA) will be entered into a random drawing for the ticket. To be eligible you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave a comment the the correct answer by the given deadline </li>
<li>Have a valid Twitter ID and leave it in the same comment </li>
<li>Be registered for MIX11 </li>
</ol>
<p>The ticket has no monetary value and cannot be transferred.</p>
