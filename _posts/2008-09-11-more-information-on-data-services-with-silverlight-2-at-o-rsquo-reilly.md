<p>O&rsquo;Reilly has been busy making preparations for my book lately. One of the items on there list was to get the information about <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/">my book up and on their web site</a>. So my book is now listed on the O&rsquo;Reilly site including a description of the contents. Soon to come will be the TOC and other information as it unfolds. You can pre-order it right on their site, too.</p>
<p>We have discussed the idea of bundling my book with the Silverlight 2 book by Tim Heuer and Jesse Liberty. Nothing concrete yet on that, but the first place to look for that would be the O&rsquo;Reilly site.</p>
<p>Here is the description, taken from the site:</p>
<p><strong>Book description</strong></p>
<p>This comprehensive tutorial teaches developers how to build data-rich applications with Silverlight 2 that draw on multiple sources of data, including how to implement &quot;in-the-cloud&quot; data access options. Packed with reusable examples, <em>Data Services with Silverlight 2</em> offers valuable information on data binding controls, LINQ, RESTful and WCF interfaces, cross-domain data, as well as Microsoft's new ADO.NET Data Services and the ADO.NET Entity Framework. <br />

This comprehensive tutorial teaches developers how to build data-rich applications with Silverlight 2 that draw on multiple sources of data, including how to implement &quot;in-the-cloud&quot; data access options. <br />
Packed with reusable examples, Data Services with Silverlight 2 offers valuable information on data binding controls, the LINQ data querying component, RESTful and WCF interfaces, cross-domain data, as well as Microsoft's new ADO.NET Data Services and the ADO.NET Entity Framework. With this book, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how Silverlight 2 applications rely on data for binding, passing, reading, saving, querying, and presentation</li>
<li>Discover how your application can call REST, web services, RSS, and HTTP services</li>
<li>Design entities that can be passed to and from a Silverlight 2 application via WCF</li>
<li>Apply data persistence techniques to Silverlight 2 applications</li>
<li>Harness the power of RESTful web services such as Amazon and Twitter</li>
<li>Learn how and when to use LINQ to SQL to query a data store</li>
<li>Retrieve and save data, using the new Entity Framework and WCF</li>
<li>Work with the RESTful ADO.NET Data Services to move data between your application and a database</li>
<li>Learn how to build RESTful services and communicate with them from Silverlight 2</li>
</ul>
<p>And more. Written by data access expert and MSDN Magazine columnist <a href="/">John Papa</a>, <em>Data Services with Silverlight 2</em> covers all of the Silverlight data access topics you need to know, including the real-world scenarios you're most likely to encounter. <br />
Examples will be available on the book's web site at <a href="http://www.silverlight2data.com">www.silverlight2data.com</a>.</p>
