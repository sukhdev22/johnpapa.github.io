<p align="justify">Bindings are the glue between the data values in the source (JavaScript objects) and the presentation in the target (the DOM). I continue to explore the KnockoutJS JavaScript library by examining <a href="http://jpapa.me/clientIn1203">Knockout’s various built in bindings in this month’s Client Insight column</a> in MSDN Magazine, that just hit the shelves.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<div data-bind="built-in-binding:vm-property1,
      another-built-in-binding:vm-property2"></div>
</pre>
<p align="justify">If you are not familiar with Knockout, you may want to first read the <a href="http://jpapa.me/clientIn1202">overview article on Knockout in last months’ Client Insight column</a> here first.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="justify"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/KnockoutJSs-Built-in-Bindings_90A8/image_4.png"><img class="aligncenter" style="background-image: none; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/KnockoutJSs-Built-in-Bindings_90A8/image_thumb_1.png" width="260" height="58" border="0" /></a></p>
<p align="justify">Knockout is ideal for building single page web apps (SPA’s) and works great with the MVVM pattern with JavaScript and HTML. If you are interested in learning Knockout from end to end, you can check out my Pluralsight course <a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm">Building HTML5 and JavaScript Apps with MVVM and Knockout</a>, which contains over 40 examples you can download with your Pluralsight subscription.</p>
