<p>I’ll be heading up to Tampa tomorrow to present “Developing Applications with the Entity Framework” at the <a href="http://www.fladotnet.com/">Tampa Bay .NET Users Group</a> on November 6th at 6:30pm, sponsored by <a href="http://ineta.org/">INETA</a>. The location for the event is:<a href="http://www.ineta.org"><img title="image" height="89" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DevelopingwiththeEntityFram.NETUserGroup_E1CD/image_3.png" width="124" align="right" border="0" /></a></p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=5426+Bay+Center+Drive+Suite+700+++Tampa,+Fl+33609&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">Microsoft Gulf States Office</a></p>    <p>5426 Bay Center Drive Suite 700 </p>    <p>Tampa, Fl 33609 </p> </blockquote>  <p>There was an email going around for the user group that had the incorrect date on it. Thursday Nov 6th is the correct date. So if you are planning on attending please mark your calendar.</p>  <p><font color="#ffffff"><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There is a good chance that I will have a sample chapter from my book <a href="/data-driven-services-with-silverlight-2/data-and-services-with-silverlight-2-table-of-contents/">Data-Driven Services with Silverlight 2</a> that I will be providing for the first time at this presentation, too. It is supposed to be ready tomorrow, so if it is, this is a good chance to be the first to get a glimpse of the book. </font></p>  <p>See you then!</p>
