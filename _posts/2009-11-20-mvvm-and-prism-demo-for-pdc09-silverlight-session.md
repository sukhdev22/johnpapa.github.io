<p>Earlier today I blogged about my session yesterday on <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL22">Advanced Large Scale Applications with Silverlight</a> at PDC 09. I had a great time at PDC but now that I am home and have a faster and more stable internet connection, I <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/Prism.Demo.PDC09.zip">zipped my demo code for the Silverlight 3, Prism, MVVM sample</a> so you can now <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/Prism.Demo.PDC09.zip">download it from here</a>. Feel free to take the code and use it as you will. </p>  <p>The majority of reusable code for the Screen Conductor pattern is in the Infrastructure project since it is generic. The code demonstrates:</p>  <ul>   <li>MVVM using the marriage of the View to the ViewModel </li>    <li>The Screen Conductor pattern/technique for view navigation </li>    <li>Prism </li>    <li>Unity </li> </ul>  <p>You should use the Northwind database and edit the server side web.config file to point to your local copy.</p>  <p>I recently wrote an article for the PnP team on this topic that goes through all of the code. Once it is available online I will post its location.</p>  <p>And if you attended my session at PDC, thank you so much for coming! If you did not get a chance to see it, you can watch it using the <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL22">recorded video of my session and see my slides here</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><font color="#ff0000">UPDATE</font>: You can now <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/printingmvvm.zip">download the source code for the Silverlight 4 MVVM demo</a> that I showed in this presentation. The sample is a VERY basic MVVM app that demonstrates how to do a simple form of MVVM that can be replicated in a larger project. Thanks for your patience!</p>
