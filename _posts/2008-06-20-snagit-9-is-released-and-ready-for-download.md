<p><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">TechSmith</a> makes 2 of my favorite applications: <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp">SnagIt</a> and <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp">Camtasia</a>. SnagIt 9 was just released this week and it has some great new features. You can check out the full story on the new release and what’s new <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/snagit/whatsnew.asp?cmp=sn9b&amp;emc=sn9rb&amp;att=wnp">from this link</a>. You can upgrade to SnagIt 9 by clicking on <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/snagit/upgrade/upgradepost.asp?verinst=8.2.3&amp;lang=enu&amp;target=snagpurchaseupgrade&amp;verreg=8.2.1&amp;lic=Single&amp;license=Single&amp;Mcode=none">this link</a>. This page also shows the differences between the features in SnagIt 8 and 9 in a chart. </p>  <p>I use SnagIt just about every day for grabbing screen captures of samples for presentations, articles, my book, sending images to clients, and for blogging. It plugs right into the Office suite of products and IE, too. I usually don;t extol the virtues of a product so blatantly, but I really love this tool. They are offering the product for $49.95 or you can upgrade to SnagIt 9 for $19.95.</p>  <p>Notice the new ribbon bar at the top, which is more Office 2007-like. It also tracks your recent captures on the bottom, which is quite handy.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SnagIt9IsReleasedandReadyforDownload_DD80/image_2.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="313" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SnagIt9IsReleasedandReadyforDownload_DD80/image_thumb.png" width="443" border="0" /></a></p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/snagit-9-is-released-and-ready-for-download/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/snagit-9-is-released-and-ready-for-download/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/snagit-9-is-released-and-ready-for-download/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'SnagIt 9 Is Released and Ready for Download';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'SnagIt 9 Is Released and Ready for Download';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '1';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
