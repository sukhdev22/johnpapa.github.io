<p>A free <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/chapter/index.html">teaser chapter is now available</a> for my book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/">Data Driven Services with Silverlight 2</a>. The free chapter, Chapter 8 &ndash; Consuming Amazon&rsquo;s RESTful Services with Silverlight 2, is in the PDF <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091/"><img title="book2" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 5px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="342" alt="book2" width="266" align="left" border="0" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/FreeTeaserChapterforDataDrivenServiceswi_D9A/book2_3.png" /></a>format and includes the rough Table of Contents along with the free chapter. You can <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/DDSS2 - sample chapter - ch08 - code.rar">download the C# code for this chapter from my site right here</a> (No worries, I will have C# and VB code available for the book when it releases).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sample chapter builds on several topics from the previous chapters to build a nice Amazon shopping cart example that allows you to shop on Amazon and build a shopping cart. You could modify this easily to add the link to make the purchase at Amazon too. One important note &hellip; if you try to run the code, you will need an Amazon key since they require one to use their services and build a shopping cart. Its free and pretty easy to set up. I talk about this in the chapter, too.</p>
<p>I hope you like it!</p>
