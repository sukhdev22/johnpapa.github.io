<p>I've been using some javascript snippet that generates a <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com">DotNetKicks</a> KickIt image for a blog post. I found the javascript to insert the KickIt link <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2007/03/08/adding-a-dotnetkicks-image-via-javascript.aspx">in a post by Jon Galloway</a>. (Thanks Jon!) I tweaked his javascript to suit my needs and it works well. However, I rarely used my converted script because I was too lazy to copy it into my posts. I tried using the some of the Windows Liver Writer plugins that are available on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WLWPlugins">CodePlex</a> and <a href="http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/2007/10/21/dotnetkicks-kick-it-counter-plugin-for-windows-live-writer/">other places</a>, but none that I found did exactly what I wanted. So I decided to create a Windows Liver Writer plugin that inserts a KickIt link in my posts. It was pretty simple to throw together, and even though there probably is a better one out there already, I had fun doing this :)</p>  <p>I used the SDK and threw together a plugin with a few properties in the sidebar pane (see below).&#160; The buttons allow you to choose a color from a color dialog. One of the features I wanted was the ability to change the colors of the links, so the properties made sense for me.</p>  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DotNetKicksPlugInforWindowsLiverWriter_1C64/image_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="344" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DotNetKicksPlugInforWindowsLiverWriter_1C64/image_thumb.png" width="226" border="0" /></a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DotNetKicksPlugInforWindowsLiverWriter_1C64/image_4.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="244" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DotNetKicksPlugInforWindowsLiverWriter_1C64/image_thumb_1.png" width="170" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>It works now (as you can see the link at the bottom of this page), but once I get some more features in it I will make the bits available for download in case anyone wants it. I plan on putting in a better mechanism to manage default values, clan up some code I don't like, and customize a few other options. If you have any requests for features, leave me a comment or <a href="/contact">shoot me an email from my contact page</a>.</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/dotnetkicks-plugin-for-windows-live-writer/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/dotnetkicks-plugin-for-windows-live-writer/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/dotnetkicks-plugin-for-windows-live-writer/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'DotNetKicks PlugIn for Windows Live Writer';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'DotNetKicks PlugIn for Windows Live Writer';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '2';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
