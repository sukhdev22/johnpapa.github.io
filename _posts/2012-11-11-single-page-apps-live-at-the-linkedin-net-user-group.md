Event Details
<blockquote>Single Page Applications (SPAs) focus on delivering better user experiences with significant client-side interactions using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. But how do you get started? This session explores the core pieces that help you build end-to-end SPA solutions including code structure and modularity, using data binding and MVVM, abstracted remote data calls, page navigation and routing, rich data features, and responsive design for mobility. Along the way I'll be touching on the ASP.NET SPA template preview, <a href="http://knockoutjs.com" target="_blank">Knockout</a>, <a href="http://sammyjs.org" target="_blank">Sammy</a>, and <a href="http://breezejs.com" target="_blank">Breeze</a>.</blockquote>
The Linked In .NET User Group (LIDNUG) has a great community, but then again LIDNUG  isn't your traditional user group. The organizers have done a fantastic job at pulling it together and bringing in great presentations from a variety of speakers, and their audiences usually get quite large for a user group. If you haven't checked them out you should go look at their upcoming events schedule as there always seems to be something interesting for all types of developers.

After the session, if you want to get more details on how to go  further with a SPA, you can refer to my <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/building-single-page-apps-with-knockout-jquery-and-web-api-ndash-the-story-begins" target="_blank">SPA blog post series</a> or watch my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps" target="_blank">video course on building Single Page Apps</a>.
