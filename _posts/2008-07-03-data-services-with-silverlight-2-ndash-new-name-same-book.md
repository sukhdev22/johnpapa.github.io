<p></p>  <p>It’s really semantics, but the title of my book has been changed slightly to now be called “Data Services with Silverlight 2”. Titles are not super important to me, but it became clear to me as the book was flowing out in Word and OneNote that the many of the topics were tending to be focused on data services. For example: using Silverlight 2 with WCF, RSS, REST, Cross Domain issues, Sockets, LINQ to XML, and so on. Dealing with data from Silverlight is the central theme of the book. This includes data binding, getting data from services, sending it back, and massaging the data. So in the end the new title just made more sense. </p>  <p>I’m pretty excited about where the book is heading, its really unfolding nicely so far. I cannot wait til its out later this year!</p>  <p><img title="book2" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="484" alt="book2" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DataServiceswithSilverlight2NewNameSameB_B190/book2_3.png" width="369" border="0" /></p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/data-services-with-silverlight-2-ndash-new-name-same-book/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/data-services-with-silverlight-2-ndash-new-name-same-book/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_url = '/all/data-services-with-silverlight-2-ndash-new-name-same-book/';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_title = 'Data Services with Silverlight 2 – New Name, Same Book';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_blurb = 'Data Services with Silverlight 2 – New Name, Same Book';</script><script type="text/javascript">var dzone_style = '1';</script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
