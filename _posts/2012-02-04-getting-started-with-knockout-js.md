It’s been 2.5 years since I handed the reigns of my Data Points column in MSDN Magazine over to Julie Lerman (who has done a masterful job with it) when I went to work for Microsoft. Now that I am back on my own I decided to rekindle my old flame and begin a new column dedicated to client side technologies. <a href="http://jpapa.me/clientIn1202">I’m happy to announce that this month the first article in my new column Client Insight is now available!</a></p> <p align="justify">What, 2 columns?! Yes, I am also continuing to write for <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/List/Papas-Perspective.aspx">VS Magazine in my monthly Papa’s Perspective column</a>, which allows me to explore a variety of topics and give my take on how technology is evolving.

And if you like Knockout, be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Authors/Details?handle=john-papa">new Pluralsight course on Knockout that is coming out later this month</a>! Yeah, its about data, and has a definite lean towards patterns I love (like MVVM) … but hey, what can I say <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/Getting-Started-with-Knockout.js_1238B/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png"></p> <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p> <p align="justify">I intend to put out some great insight into client side topics such as Silverlight, JavaScript, XAML, Windows 8, Windows Phone, CSS,&nbsp; HTML, and much more.
