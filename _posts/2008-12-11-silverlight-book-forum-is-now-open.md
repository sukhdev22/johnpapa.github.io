<p>My book went to print today, so it will be available for purchase as soon as they finish waxing and polishing it. I plan on having materials to supplement the book including all code samples in C# and VB, a forum for questions and discussions, as well as additional material on <a href="http://www.silverlight-data.com">www.silverlight-data.com</a> . These will be made available over the next few weeks as we get closer to the book being available at stores. The first of these are the forums, which was launched tonight. You can <a href="http://forums.oreilly.com/category/41/Data-Driven-Services-with-Silverlight-2/">check out the forums</a> and post any questions or general discussion right now over at the O’Reilly site. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596523091"><img title="book2" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="260" alt="book2" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightBookForumIsNowOpen_11123/book2_3.png" width="202" border="0" /></a></p>
