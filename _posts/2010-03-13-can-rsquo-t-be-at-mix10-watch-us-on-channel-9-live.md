<p>I am really looking forward to MIX10 this year. The keynotes, sessions, parties and the best part of it all for me is talking with all of the attendees (well I can’t talk to everyone, but I try my best to get around). I will be hanging in the Commons quite often, so please come by and hang with me. Who doesn’t want to sit and chat with the Sicilian Silverlight Evangelist? ;-)</p>  <p>I’ll be on twitter all week tweeting, so grab a quick virtual chat with me at <a href="http://twitter.com/John_Papa">@john_papa</a>.</p>  <p>OK so if you cannot make it to MIX this year, you should really check out Channel 9 Live. They started this at PDC09, I believe. Basically there is a live stream starting after each keynote where there are hosts who interviews great guests like Scott Guthrie and Charlie Kindel. Some interviews are pure question and answer sessions too. At PDC Adam Kinney I hosted a session after the keynote where we answered questions that were tweeted to <a href="http://twitter.com/ch9live">@ch9Live</a>. We had so many questions that we could have gone on for hours.</p>  <p>So for MIX10 Channel 9 Live is at it again. Here is <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/NicFill/Channel-9-Live-at-MIX10--Who-What-Why-When-and-How/">the full Channel 9 schedule</a>. I’ll be on live for a few sessions with a great crew of interviewers and hosts, too:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Title: MIX10 Day 1 Keynote After Party</strong>      <br />Recapping the announcements and answering all your questions from the MIX10 Day 1 Keynote      <br />Time: 10:30AM – 11:30AM      <br />Who: John Papa, Adam Kinney, Loke Uei Tan and Nic Fillingham      <br />Ask questions about: MIX10 Day 1 Keynote announcements</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Title: This Week on Channel 9 - MIX10 Day 1 Wrap Up Edition</strong>      <br />Who: Adam Kinney, John Papa, Jeff Sandquist and Dan Fernandez      <br />Time: 5:00PM      <br />Ask questions about: all the questions that didn’t get answered from day 1</p>    <p><strong>Title: This Week on Channel 9 - MIX10 Day 2 Wrap Up Edition</strong>      <br />Who: Adam Kinney, John Papa, Jeff Sandquist and Dan Fernandez      <br />Time: 5:00PM      <br />Ask questions about: all the questions that didn’t get answered from day 2</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/NicFill/Channel-9-Live-at-MIX10--Who-What-Why-When-and-How/"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/CantBeatMIX10WatchusonChannel9Live_A9B2/image_3.png" width="244" height="186" /></a> </p>  <p>So be sure to check out Channel 9 Live.
