<p></p>  <p>I’ve been using <a href="http://tangiblesoftwaresolutions.com/">Instant VB</a> for a few months now to convert code snippets in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523092/johnpanet-20">Silverlight 2 book</a> from C# to VB. I tried a few free tools, but they just could not compare with the experience I had with Instant VB. For small snippets its nice. It converts them very quickly and accurately. But where the product really shines is in converting&#160; an entire solution full of several project and a ton of files. It converts large amounts of code very fast which is awesome for me …&#160; as I am using it to convert several C# solutions to VB for my book. As I go through each chapter I convert the entire project to VB and it just flies through the code. Here is a smaller solution that it converted in 4 seconds.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="159" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/InstantVBandInstantCPayingHugeDividends_12778/image_3.png" width="479" border="0" /> </p>  <p>The best part of the software is the support. Every single problem I have had where a conversion did not do what I expected was fixed within a week. Seriously! I am writing the book with beta software and CTP versions of toolkits, so I expect some issues. As I have encountered them I have gotten emails back within a few days (and sometimes the same day) with a new version posted on the web site with a fix.</p>  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I started out trying this software using the trial version. When I first started encountering problems due to the Silverlight 2 beta bits and converting it, Tangible offered me the software license for free since we were helping each other out. I was helping find issues with the conversions in the Silverlight 2 conversions which helps their product get better and obviously I benefit from using the software. So yes, I am getting something out of this software … but anyone who knows me knows that even when I get free software if I did not like it, I would NOT give it a good review. I have absolutely loved using this software as it has saved me hours of time.</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=/all/instant-vb-and-instant-c-ndash-paying-huge-dividends/"><img src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=/all/instant-vb-and-instant-c-ndash-paying-huge-dividends/&amp;bgcolor=0080C0&amp;fgcolor=FFFFFF&amp;border=000000&amp;cbgcolor=D4E1ED&amp;cfgcolor=000000" alt="DotNetKicks Image" border="0/"></a></div><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="text-align:left; margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;"><script type="text/javascript"><!-- var dzone_url = '/all/instant-vb-and-instant-c-ndash-paying-huge-dividends/'; var dzone_title = 'Instant VB and Instant C# – Paying Huge Dividends'; var dzone_blurb = 'Instant VB and Instant C# – Paying Huge Dividends'; var dzone_style = '2'; --></script><script language="javascript" src="http://widgets.dzone.com/widgets/zoneit.js"></script> </div>
