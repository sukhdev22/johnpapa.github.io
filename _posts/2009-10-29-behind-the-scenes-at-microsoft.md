<p>I’m a little over a week into my new role as the Silverlight Evangelist at Microsoft and so far it has been a blast! I’ve had a lot of joking questions about how much the implants hurt when they put them in, so I thought I might share with you all a quick behind the scenes looks at the new recruits getting their implants. As you can see, they only had to remove my head for a little while.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="017" border="0" alt="017" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/BehindtheScenesatMicrosoft_1318E/017_3.jpg" width="511" height="314" /> </p>  <p>Yes, I am kidding. </p>  <p>Seriously though … I’m really enjoying working here, the people are brilliant and great to work with, and the work is very fulfilling. Currently I am preparing a session for PDC titled <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL22">“Advanced Topics for Building Large-Scale Applications with Microsoft Silverlight”</a>. So if you are heading to the PDC, be sure to check it out!</p>  <p><a href="http://microsoftpdc.com"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="pdc09widebanner" border="0" alt="pdc09widebanner" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/BehindtheScenesatMicrosoft_1318E/pdc09widebanner_3.png" width="517" height="98" /></a></p>
