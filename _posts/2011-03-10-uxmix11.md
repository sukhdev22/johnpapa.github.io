<p><strong>Do You Dig Design?</strong> <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/ux">Then you’ll want to check out the UX Lightning series at MIX11</a>. We’ve lined up 12 expert speakers to present on various design and UX topics in a new session series we are dubbing UX Lightning. This series was inspired by a desire to stimulate creative thinking about UX in a compelling format. The result? Less fluff, less syntax, and much more creative and inspiring content!</p>  <p><strong>How Does This Work?</strong> The concept is that each hour long session has a theme where a speaker presents their topic using auto-timed slides for 10 minutes, then the next speaker steps on the stage and presents their topic in 10 minutes, and this repeats with 4 different speakers over the length of a 60 minute session. If you are unfamiliar with the format, here is a <a href="http://igniteshow.com/videos/how-and-why-give-ignite-talk">great video</a> that explains something similar. Each presenter gets your creative juices flowing for 10 minutes with slides that are synced with their presentation (no human clicker!). This means that content will flow quickly, and most importantly attendees get four times the goodness out of each session.</p>  <p><strong>What’s The Lineup?</strong> We have 12 awesome presenters with some Inspiring, Crafty and Mind Bending topics. In fact, those are the titles for the sessions!</p>  <h4><a href="http://live.visitmix.com/"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="clip_image001" border="0" alt="clip_image001" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/414cb3f1b1f7_B673/clip_image001_36e4ec38-92b0-4dc6-b41b-3c2cb4f95e70.gif" width="547" height="144" /></a></h4>  <h4><font style="font-weight: bold">Session 1: Inspiring UX</font></h4>  <p>Want to be inspired by design and UX?
