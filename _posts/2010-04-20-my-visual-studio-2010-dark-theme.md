<p>Everyone has their preferences for their development IDE. Colors, fonts, tools, keyboard shortcuts, etc. I&rsquo;m certainly no different. I really prefer the darker themes over the white background. The brightness of the white background wears on me after a while. The dark theme sets me in a mellow coding mood :)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t generally keep a theme exactly &ldquo;as is&rdquo; for a long time. Instead I start with a theme and I tinker with it as I find things I don&rsquo;t like. I&rsquo;ve taken my latest theme and uploaded it here. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/Papa-VS2010-Themes.zip">Feel free to download it from here and tinker as much as you like</a>. I included Resharper schemes, too. (If you do not use Resharper it won&rsquo;t affect you.) Or feel free to skip them altogether :)</p>
<p>Here are some screen captures of the code window using my color scheme. Click on them for the larger images.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyVisualStudio2010DarkTheme_12480/image_2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" width="439" height="316" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyVisualStudio2010DarkTheme_12480/image_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>Here is some XAML &hellip;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyVisualStudio2010DarkTheme_12480/image_4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" width="441" height="310" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyVisualStudio2010DarkTheme_12480/image_thumb_1.png" /></a></p>
<p>I do use some yellows, reds, oranges in my theme too in addition to the blue, green, gray hues. You just don&rsquo;t see them all in these caps. I&rsquo;m sure I will tinker some more with this, but if you find a nice theme or if you modify this theme, go ahead link to it in the comments.</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><strong>UPDATE (4/25/2010): </strong></font>I updated this theme and added another blue one <a href="/silverlight/updated-blue-and-dark-visual-studio-2010-themes/">from this post here:</a></p>
