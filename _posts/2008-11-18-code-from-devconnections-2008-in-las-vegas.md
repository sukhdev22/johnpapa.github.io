<p>I just uploaded my code demonstrations for my 3 presentations at DevConnections in Las Vegas last week. You can <a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/Connections 2008 Demos.rar">download all 3 sets of demos from this link</a>. Inside the compressed file are the code samples for all 3 of the sessions:</p>  <ul>   <li>Data Access with Silverlight 2 </li>    <li>Developing with Enterprise Library Data Access Application Block </li>    <li>Implementing the Entity Framework </li> </ul>  <p>Silverlight seemed to take a big stage at the conference as there were a lot of sessions on the topic from both 3rd party speakers like me and the Microsoft crew. It was also the topic that had the most questions that I received. The Entity Framework was still a hot topic, too. I even showed how to use the Entity Framework with Silverlight, which was interesting to a lot of folk. I wish I had more time to show Astoria with both, but there is never enough time … that topic was pretty hot as well.</p>  <p>I had a great time at the conference and really enjoyed meeting a ton of new people and reconnecting with some old friends. My wife even convinced me to get a massage while I was out there. We got a “couples massage” which basically means we both get to be in the same room for it. It was the first massage I ever got … wow, is it relaxing! I play a lot of sports and always have aches and pains, so this was very nice.</p>  <p>Until the next event!</p>
