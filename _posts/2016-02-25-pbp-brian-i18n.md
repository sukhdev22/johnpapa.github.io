Recently I had a great opportunity to sit down with my good friend and expert i18n developer Brian Clark to build internationalization into an Angular app. You can [watch us build the app here at Pluralsight](https://jpapa.me/pbpi18nclark).

Internationalization is a powerful way to provide a better experience for users around the world by translating applications into local languages. Brian creates an Angular 1 app from scratch using Hot Towel. He then shows how to integrate the popular angular-translate library, add multiple languages to an application, and discusses the options for changing languages in an application. The cool part about i18n is that it's fairly straight-forward to add internationalization in your own Angular applications.

You can download the exercise files for this course [from Brian's github repo here](https://github.com/clarkio/angular-i18n).
