<p>Being a huge Yankees fan and living out of market like I do I recently purchased the MLB.com TV package so I can watch the games on the Internet. They sued to use Real video streaming however I cranked up the video tonight and noticed some changes form last year. After a quick check, yep, its using Silverlight! I'm sure this was announced somewhere along the way and I just purely missed it. But how cool is it that MLB.com is using Silverlight! </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightandBaseball_131C2/mlb_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="302" alt="mlb" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightandBaseball_131C2/mlb_thumb.png" width="535" border="0"></a> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Yes, I spray painted some logos in the image :) to protect, well, myself!</p> <p>&nbsp;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightandBaseball_131C2/SL_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="92" alt="SL" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightandBaseball_131C2/SL_thumb.png" width="244" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Notice the media controls at the bottom of the video. These appear when you hover over the video.</p> <p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=http%3a%2f%2fjohnpapa.net%2fall%2f/all/silverlight-and-baseball/%2f"><img alt="kick it on DotNetKicks.com" src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=http%3a%2f%2fjohnpapa.net%2fall%2f/all/silverlight-and-baseball/%2f&amp;bgcolor=3399FF" border="0"></a></p>
