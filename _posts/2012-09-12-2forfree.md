<p>Special thanks to both <a href="http://twitter.com/scottgu">Scott Guthrie</a> and <a href="http://pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> for pulling together a special promotion that allows you to get a free 1-month subscription to watch both my <a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm">Knockout / MVVM</a> course and my <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps">Single Page Apps with HTML5, ASP.NET Web API, Knockout, and jQuery</a> at no cost!&nbsp; That’s over 10 hours of material for free!  <p>For full details please see <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/09/11/great-free-courses-on-building-html5-apps-using-asp-net-web-api-knockout-js-and-jquery.aspx">Scott Guthrie’s post about the promotion</a> for details about how to sign up and get access to the course. Here is a quick quote I grabbed from Scott’s post: <blockquote> <p>To get access to the course you simply follow <a href="http://twitter.com/pluralsight">@pluralsight</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/john_papa">@john_papa</a> on Twitter and then <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/TwitterOffer/spa">visit this page</a> and enter your Twitter name using the form on it.&nbsp; Pluralsight will then send you a private twitter message containing the access code that you can use to subscribe to the courses (and download the course exercise files).&nbsp; Once you are subscribed to the course you have one month to watch the course (and you can watch it as many times as you want during the month). Pluralsight is running the promotion through Sept 18th – so <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/TwitterOffer/spa">sign-up now</a> to get access.&nbsp; </p></blockquote> <p>If you are new to Knockout, then I recommend watching my Knockout course first, then watching my SPA course, as it builds on that Knockout knowledge. <p>Here is a <a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm">link to my Knockout course</a>: <p><a href="http://jpapa.me/komvvm"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/75f74acf2a0e_7D2A/image_3.png" width="520" height="104"></a> <p>Here is a <a href="http://jpapa.me/spaps">link to my Single Page Apps course</a>: <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="/wp-content/uploads/media/Windows-Live-Writer/d4d49c57f31e_12ABB/image_9.png" width="500" height="104">
