Especially when I can combine modern architectural patterns that I use in most enterprise applications to mobile devices, as well. My latest article, titled "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/01/DataPoints/">Accessing Data From a Mobile Application</a>" is now available online in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/01">January MSDN Magazine</a> issue. </p> <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/01/DataPoints"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="335" alt="January08Coverlg" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AccessingDataFromaMobileApplication_80A7/January08Coverlg_3.gif" width="257" border="0"></a></p> <p>Here is a summary of the article:</p> <p>Data access is an important aspect of developing applications with the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> .NET Compact Framework for Windows Mobile<sup>®</sup> devices. By using the existing architecture to send and receive data between your mobile application and your application server, you can pass data with either DataSets, custom objects, or scalar values.  <p>In this installment of DataPoints, I will discuss best practices for data access strategies when developing mobile applications for Smartphones. I will also demonstrate how to design a data-driven Smartphone application that can display and save data over the Internet. I will show you how to communicate with a server application that exposes methods to get data using a DataSet, custom objects, and a generic List&lt;T&gt; of entities.
