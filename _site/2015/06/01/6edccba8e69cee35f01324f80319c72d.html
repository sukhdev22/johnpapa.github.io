<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>I wanted to touch base with you because I recently helped create an interesting research graphic called “Choosing Your Javascript Framework” http://www.webdesigndegreecenter.org/choosing-javascript-framework/, which I think would be of value to your readers (I say that because as one of your readers, it’s a topic that interests me).</p>

<p>If you agree, I would be excited to see you post it on your site for your other regular visitors to enjoy.</p>

<p>Thanks and regards,
Anna Mininkova
