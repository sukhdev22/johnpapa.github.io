They just don't seem to mix ... but hey, I'm game! In all seriousness, I am looking forward to presenting at this conference as the attendees all make their livings in the academic world. It seems like a great opportunity to see what and how the teachers/professors are teaching the college students. It will be interesting to hear their questions to see how they view the fast changing world of development with .NET. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos">Dino Esposito </a>will be there as well as a few other presenters. I'm looking forward to saying hi to my old friend <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos">Dino </a>as I have not seen him in a few years now. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;<o:p></o:p></p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>This week I have been spending some free time in the reviewing the VS.NET 2005 Release Candidate. There are some nice features in the product that I am really excited about such as the new data designers and the TableAdapter in ADO.NET 2. Of course the oft discussed generics are pretty awesome, too. Partial classes, an oldie but goodie (hard to believe that feature seems like it has been around so long and its not in a live version yet). I'll be posting what I find in the VS.NET 2005 RC in the very near future. </p>
<p>Thereis a lot to talk about!&nbsp;"Edit and continue", generics, code snippets, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is your favorite new feature? [ at least for this week :-) ]</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/vs-net-2005-release-candidate-installation.html">VS.NET 2005 Release Candidate Installation</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I went out to grab the <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/">VS.NET 2005 Release Candidate</a> and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/2005/productinfo/ctp.mspx">SQL Server 2005 September CTP</a> a few days ago from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions">MSDN subscriber site</a>. The download took a loooooooong time since the 2 combined where over 4 GB. But all in all the site was responding well and I can't really complain since the download speeds were pretty good. Virtual PC makes the installation process so much easier. (I recommend reading <a href="/blogs/mark.digiovanni/articles/61862.aspx">Mark's article on VPC</a> for some pointers.)</p>
<p>Overall, the installation took about 1.5 hours for VS.NET 2005 RC and another 15 minutes for the MSDN documentation on my VPC image. I'll be diving into it this weekend so I can update some of my test code that I have written and see what changes or refactors I might need to make. I'm interested in seeing how System.Transactions has been flushed out and in testing the rest of the ADO.NET modifications that have been discussed by the DataWorks team. I'll blog more on these topics and the changes as I get deeper.</p>

    <p>If you are going to be in the Albany, NY area on Tuesday, Nov 8th, stop by at 6:30pm at the <a href="http://www.tvug.net/">Tech Valley .NET User Group</a> meeting. I'll be <a href="http://www.tvug.net/site/294/default.aspx">presenting and demonstrating the enhancements to ADO.NET 2</a> using the latest release candidate bits. </p>
<p>You can find a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=5+Maxwell+Drive,+Clifton+Park,+NY,+12065&amp;hl=en">map and directions here</a> (from Google Maps).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the presentation's abstract:</p>
<p>Data access using ADO.NET is at the core of most .NET enterprise applications. While ADO.NET 1.x is powerful, its successor ADO.NET 2 contains several new features that are can benefit an application. We'll review these new features and how to take advantage of them including binary serialization of DataSets, new indexing performance features, enhancements to the DataTable, using the new ASP.NET data source objects to bind to DataSets or custom classes, and batch updates.</p>
<p> <ul> <li>Performance <li>DataTable Enhancements <li>DataTableReader <li>Loading Data <li>Changing RowState <li>Batch Updates <li>Invoking Stored Procedures <li>Invoking Parameterized queries <li>DataSources (primarily ObjectDataSource)</li> <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/tips-on-presenting-and-speaking.html">Tips on Presenting and Speaking</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>The amount of good content in the Microsoft WebCasts is quite amazing. The conferences such as VSlive, Tech Ed, Code Camps&nbsp;and Dev Connections are great too. Of course there are the occasional duds, but overall there is a lot of good content in there. For me, what sets apart a good&nbsp;presentation is not only the content but also the effectiveness of the presenter. OK, we are all pretty geeked up and excited about VS.NET 2005. Now imagine Alan Greenspan presenting Generics or ADO.NET 2. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz See my point? Even the most awesome topics can lose their audience if the presenter is boring the crowd into a deep sleep. </p>
<p>There are entire classes on being an effective speaker/presenter, but I'm just going to focus on a few things that are no brainers to me that I have seen a lot of quite recently.</p>
<ol> <li>Look at your audience. Don't avoid eye contact and turn your back on them. This is an easy way to lose their attention. <li>Don't sniff into the microphone. Yes. I have heard this recently by a well known and very competent developer/presenter. It really grossed me out enough to the point where I could not listen any more. <li>Avoid saying "um". If you don't know what to say, say nothing. A short pause is fine. <li>Avoid long pauses. If you are waiting for code to run (often the case), make sure you have something pertinent to talk about to fill in the time. <li>Don't make off color jokes. You really don't want stand in front of 100 people in a room and make an inappropriate joke (or worse, have it recorded). I've seen it and it can turn ugly.. </li>

    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/thoughts-on-dell-dimension-and-dell-support.html">Thoughts on Dell Dimension and Dell Support</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>A few months ago I am finishing up my article on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/02/DataPoints/">System.Transactions</a> for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag">MSDN Magazine</a> at about 3am, decide to hit the sack and review the article one last time before I submit it the next day (the due date). I get up around 8am and go to look at it and the PC locks up and&nbsp;shuts down. I'm softly saying "no, no, no!". I boot up, and it says "bwahahahaha! your hard drive is toast!" Greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat! Long story short, I lost the article. No, I did not back it up. Everything else was backed up just a day earlier, but I had not yet backed up my article nor had I emailed it so I could not even go to the email server to get it. ugh. Thankfully, the MSDN crew were very good to me and let me have a few extra days to recreate my article (oh, that was fun ... talk about deja vu!).</p>
<p>So now I have my new hard drive ... and guess what ... today the hard drive blew again and the&nbsp;CPU fan blew on me! I am so happy!!! NOT! Anyway, the <a href="www.dell.com">Dell </a>support was very helpful once again. They are sending me the new parts and a person to install them for me. yes I could do it on my own but I am paying for next business day support so why not take advantage of it? Overall I am very happy with the next business day support from Dell. I have 4 Dell computers, only 1 of which has had any hardware failures. But on both of the occasions where the parts failed the phone support was quick to get to (under 3 minutes) and they were quick to get the parts out to me and a technician on the way. Today, I did have to request a technician come out instead of them overnighting the parts to me. That bugged me a little, but he gave in quickly and agreed.</p>
<p>So I spect about $180 for 3 yr next business day service and I got out of it a new CPU fan and 2 new hard drives not to mention next day installation by a technician. So the cost was well worth it for me, especially since I am a developer and this is my main development PC. Overall I give it a thumbs up. </p>
<p>I am considering getting a new PC sometime this year and was thinking about skipping the NBD service from <a href="www.dell.com">Dell </a>this time. I think my experiences have now proven that for me, it is well worth the extra money. I am now considering possibly getting the Dimension with the dual core processor. If I do, I will blog about how it does or doesn't&nbsp;help speed anything up.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1: OK, they never showed up the next business day nor did they call! At least a phone call or email would have been nice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Dell still hasn't showed. I called them and they say they can't promise a time. &lt;/sigh&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day 3: Where is Dell? Not here. I called them and they say they are sorry but they can't promise a day or time. </strong></p>
<p><strong> &lt;P&gt;<strong>Business Day 4:  Didn’t call them today. Was hoping they would just show up. It’s been 6 days or 4 business days. Thankfully I have another computer. </strong>&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Day 5: No word once again, Dell says they should be here.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Day 6: Ah, finally someone at Dell tells me that someone did not enter the support call correctly and that nobody has been dispatched. The call has been re-entered and they now say it is likely for Friday (8th business day). Can’t wait for the service survey they always send me.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Day 7: Service tech arrives with the parts, installs them, takes off. Very professional and quick. Can’t complain about his service. If the original guy I talked to had just entered the call correctly or someone had caught it, this all would’ve been fixed a week ago. &lt;/rant&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</strong></p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I’ve been pretty absent from the blogging scene of late. Life can throw you many twists and turns and many of them are when they are least convenient or least expected. My family has had one of these thrown at us recently and I am thankful for God and my family for being here for me and for each other to help us through.</p>
<p>Like many people around the world, my family has been dealing with an immediate family member battling cancer. I am&nbsp;blessed&nbsp;to have a large and loving family with whom I am very close. We are helping each other&nbsp;through this as well as we can as it is always difficult dealing with our mortality. Cancer has a way of breaking down the person that you know physically and the medications have a way of breaking them down mentally. In some ways you wish they could not be on medication so they could live out what they have left without the inconvenience of 20 pills a day that mess with your mind and body. In a more selfish sense, I sometimes wish that the pills will continue so I can enjoy my family member for as long as possible. These and a lot of other thoughts go through your head when you are faced with such dire situations.</p>
<p>I am thankful for the time I have had and the future time I will have with my family. I thank God for blessing us with all that we have. I cherish the times that remain and will regret nothing. I love my family and God as they all have been very good to me.</p>
<p>Recently I have been trying to explain to one of my young children why our family member is sick. What that means, in terms she can understand. That is a difficult conversation I had hoped she was too young to have. But she surprised me in that she was ready to talk about it. Willing. Wanted to talk about it. Sometimes people get sick and their time on earth will end soon. It makes us sad, but it is also a good thing as God is calling us home to heaven. We should cherish our family and our loved ones. Discussing this sometimes complicated situation with my daughter helped me put it into perspective that while this is still a sad time, that it is important to cherish all that we have before it is gone. Have no regrets in life. Play with your children, kiss your spouse, tell them that you love them. Call your sister whom you haven’t seen nor talked to in years. Visit your elderly relatives. </p>
<p>I am certainly no saint, in fact I imagine that I have sinned more than my share. Sometimes it just helps to get these things down in writing. I am thankful that I am finally beginning to understand these things.</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I’ve been getting my slides and code samples together over the past few weeks for the upcoming conferences. The next one I’ll be at is at the end of this month in <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/">Boston at VSLive</a> talking about transactions. The session is titled <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/smart-sessions.aspx#lightweightpromotable">Lightweight Promotable Transactions using System Transactions and ADO.NET 2</a> and is at <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/agenda.aspx">2pm on June 30th</a>. Below is the synopsis of the session and the agenda from my slide deck … please drop by and say hi if you are attending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/smart-sessions.aspx#lightweightpromotable">Lightweight Promotable Transactions using System Transactions and ADO.NET 2</a></strong></p>
<p>The.NET Framework v2 includes the System.Transactions namespace that enhances transactional support for managed code. We'll discuss how System.Transactions can handle transactions without using other common practices such as deriving from a ServicedComponent, using interception, or using reflection. Designed to integrate with SQL Server 2005, System.Transactions supports the intelligent and automatic promotion of local lightweight transactions to fully distributed transactions. It also introduces a new class called LightweightTransactionManager, which is a faster alternative to using the DTC for local transactions. We'll walk through examples that modify the default transactional settings of the implicit local transaction and modify the isolation level, timeout period, and transaction's context, and more. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p>
<ul> <li>Transactional Support <li>Why use System.Transactions <li>Resource Managers <li>Ambient Transactions <li>Lightweight Transaction Manager (LTM) <li>Lightweight Transactions <ul> <li>Promoting them <li>How and when (and when not) </li> <li>Implicit Transactions <ul> <li>Implicit because of default connection string setting of enlist=true <li>TransactionScope object with default settings <li>Isolation Level, Timeout Period, Transaction Context </li> <li>Explicit Transactions <ul> <li>Enlisting in a transaction </li></ul> <li>New Interfaces</li> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
