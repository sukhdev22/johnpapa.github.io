  <div>
    
    
    <p>Here is the mock up of my upcoming Silverlight 2 book that <a href="/all/as-it-once-was-i-am-writing-a-book/">I mentioned earlier today</a>. The title is still up in the air, as is the cover art, and ... let's face it ...&nbsp; just about everything except for the release date of Nov/Dec 2008.&nbsp; I just wanted to see what it might look like so I mocked up a fake book cover to the amusement of myself and my daughters. Though I think they want a cat or an eagle on the cover :-)</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/05/14/as-it-once-was-i-am-writing-a-book.html">As it Once Was, I am Writing a Book</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>It is 3 am and I am learning the subtle balance of typing with one hand while swaying and comforting&nbsp; my new born child in the other. She was up late crying ... a lot. She had colic. So we took turns staying up with her to comfort her. The problem was I also had a book to finish. </p>
<p>It has been years since I last wrote any part of a book. I authored or co-authored 8 books on cool topics including SQL Server, ADO, and XML back in the late 90's and early 2000's. Then something happened ... something wonderful. 3 times. I had a child, and another, and another. Suddenly the massive amounts of time I was dedicating to writing books morphed into a blissful parenting experience. I still enjoyed writing so I hit the articles hard writing more than 70 articles over the past 7 years and I spoke at several conferences. </p>
<p>My kids aren't full grown but I've recently had an urge to get a book out. I've been deep into the new data access technologies since they were announced. I've been working hard at making practical Silverlight 2 applications that are more about how to implement Silverlight 2 in line of business applications as opposed to just making pretty circles bounce on a screen (though that is cool too). A few weeks later my book idea is refined and on its way to being written and on the shelves. I expect it to be out in November of this year.</p>
<p>I expect my next few months are now going to be full of work, writing a book and family time ... basically eliminating all sleep. Just like it used to be. At least this time I can use 2 hands to type.</p>

    <p>Tonight I will be joining the <a href="http://sarasotasql.net/">Sarasota SQL Server User group</a> and the <a href="http://www.sarasotadev.net/">Sarasota .NET User group</a> at their combined May 2008 meeting. I will be presenting the Entity Framework and LINQ using the new bits that came out 2 days ago on Monday including the new features that it brings. I always have a good time at user groups and especially so when its a hot topic like the Entity Framework and LINQ. </p>
<p>I'll be showing several demonstrations using the Entity Framework that demonstrate how to use it in different scenarios and its future direction. I'm looking forward it!</p>
<p>Here is the logistical information for tonight's event and Here is link to a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGIH_en__265__265&amp;q=2635+Fruitville+Rd,+Sarasota,+FL+34237,+USA&amp;um=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title">google map</a> for directions.</p>

This includes several updates, includes support for SQL Server 2008, and has a few new products including the Entity Framework, LINQ to Entities and ADO.NET Data Services (aka Astoria). <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/05/12/visual-studio-2008-and-net-framework-3-5-service-pack-1-beta.aspx">ScottGu posted some notes</a> regarding what's included in the service pack, as well.</p>
<p>Of course all of this is released 2 days before I have a demonstration on the Entity Framework and LINQ to Entities on Wednesday to the Sarasota .NET and SQL Server User groups. So I have a few modifications to make for my presentations.</p>
<p>I received an error when I first tried to install it. The problem was that the service pack was in conflict with Silverlight Tools Beta for Visual Studio 2008 which I was using to create/edit Silverlight 2 applications. Once uninstalling this i was able to get the service pack to install properly. Scott Gu's post discusses this issue as well as the importance of making sure you install Vista SP 1 first.</p>

    <p>My friend and colleague <a href="http://www.brianpeek.com/">Brian Peek</a> has been developing some awesome and fun applications for a while. As a contributing author to MSDN's Coding 4 Fun Bran has been creating some cool applications that you should really check out at his site at <a href="http://www.brianpeek.com">www.brianpeek.com</a>. </p>
<p>Not his latest, but certainly one of his most famous, achievement is his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/03/14/1879033.aspx">Wiimote .NET Library</a> and the uses that he is putting it to. Brian got the attention of Newsweek magazine for the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/03/14/1879033.aspx">Wiimote .NET library</a> that he authored. They interviewed him and the article can be found on line at <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/136381">http://www.newsweek.com/id/136381</a>.&nbsp; The print article should be in the May 19th issue of the International Edition of Newsweek.</p>

    <a href="/all/2008/05/07/silverlight-wcf-and-linq-to-sql.html">Silverlight, WCF and LINQ to SQL</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I've had some requests lately to write some articles that work with LINQ to SQL. I've ben focusing on the Entity Framework a lot due to its vast nature and that fact that its still relatively unknown to many people. So I am going to work on a LINQ to SQL project that ties into a multi tier model. I am also going to show how this can be hooked into a&nbsp; Silverlight 2 UI that connects through WCF to the lower layers. </p>
<p>I'll probably be demonstrating these first at an event I am trying to set up with <a href="http://www.devfish.net/">Joe Healy</a> of Microsoft in Tampa this coming August. The demos will be ready way before then, but I wanted to have some cool materials for this event. There is no title nor date yet, but once the event is set I will be sure to let blog about it. It should be a great day overall.</p>
<p>I also plan on giving some love to the Entity Framework, regular persistence/mapper models, MVP patterns and more. I just have to find a way to work it all in and still give enough to each topic. Of course, this means all demos are subject to change, but the content will be fresh and cool for certain.</p>
<p>Here is a very poorly and quickly thrown together diagram of one of the demos I am tweaking.</p>

    <p>Today I decided to try out a new theme for my site. <a href="http://richmercer.com/graffiti-themes/#deepblue">Rich Mercer has a handful of nice themes</a> posted in his site including this one, which is a variation of the Point Space Blue theme. I'm going to try it out and see where it takes me. Its a pretty clean theme though there are a few items I need to touch up for certain. Hey if anything, my daughter likes this one the best so far.</p>
<p>I have been thrilled with the flexibility and the low maintenance of <a href="http://graffiticms.com">Graffiti CMS</a>. I spend so much less time fixing problems than I used to with other products that I will leave unnamed.</p>

    <p>Being a huge Yankees fan and living out of market like I do I recently purchased the MLB.com TV package so I can watch the games on the Internet. They sued to use Real video streaming however I cranked up the video tonight and noticed some changes form last year. After a quick check, yep, its using Silverlight! I'm sure this was announced somewhere along the way and I just purely missed it. But how cool is it that MLB.com is using Silverlight! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightandBaseball_131C2/mlb_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="302" alt="mlb" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightandBaseball_131C2/mlb_thumb.png" width="535" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I spray painted some logos in the image :) to protect, well, myself!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightandBaseball_131C2/SL_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="92" alt="SL" src="/wp-content/uploads/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SilverlightandBaseball_131C2/SL_thumb.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>Notice the media controls at the bottom of the video. These appear when you hover over the video.</p>
