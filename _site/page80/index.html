  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/custom-tooltips-in-winform-treeviews.html">Custom Tooltips in WinForm TreeViews</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>This is one of those simple coding issues that I was recently faced with that I wish I had a simple example to show me how to knock this out. I had to create a treeview whose nodes were supposed to display a tooltip that could change based on the selected node. Pretty straightforward issue overall, but I ran into a problem: the tooltips weren't working. OK, so it was a big problem with a simple solution. Long story short, there are a few key ingredients in setting tooltips that change based on the node you have selected. My problem stemmed from forgetting to deactivate the tooltip and then reactivate it. I did not see this anywhere in the documentation but I stumbled across it by trying different properties out. Now, maybe this is common knowledge to some or even most of you, but to me it sure wasn't. But I have run into controls in the past that needed to be turned off and on to work properly. So I guess I just chalk this up as one more.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is a short list of things to look for:</p>
<ul> <li>drag a tooltip control onto your designer that has the treeview control <li>create a mousemove event handler on the treeview to kick off the tooltip <li>check to make sure that a node is selected, or get out <li>check to make sure a different node is selected than previously, or get out <li>Make the tooltip deactive (tip.Active = false;) <li>Set the tooltip text (tip.SetTooltip(tree, toolTipText); <li>Make the tooltip active (tip.Active = true;)</li> <p>Now, I had an object stored in the tag of each treeview node. So I grab it, figure out which obejct I have and get a property of the object to use for the tooltip. This part is up to your implementation of course.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <fieldset><legend>Tooltips</legend><pre><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> <span style="COLOR: blue">private void</span> tree_MouseMove(<span style="COLOR: blue">object</span> sender, System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs e) { TreeNode currentNode = tree.GetNodeAt(e.X, e.Y); <span style="COLOR: blue">if</span> ((currentNode == <span style="COLOR: blue">null</span>) || (previousNode == currentNode) || (currentNode.Tag == <span style="COLOR: blue">null</span>)) <span style="COLOR: blue">return</span>; <span style="COLOR: blue">string</span> toolTipText = string.Empty; previousNode = currentNode; <span style="COLOR: blue">object</span> o = previousNode.Tag; <span style="COLOR: blue">if</span> (o <span style="COLOR: blue">is</span> Class1) toolTipText = Class1.Description; <span style="COLOR: blue">else if</span> (<span style="COLOR: blue">o is</span> Class2) toolTipText = Class2.Description; <span style="COLOR: blue">else if</span> (o <span style="COLOR: blue">is</span> Class3) toolTipText = Class3.Description; <span style="COLOR: blue">else</span> toolTipText = <span style="COLOR: blue">string</span>.Empty; <span style="COLOR: green">// Turn off the tooltip so we can change the text</span> <span style="COLOR: blue">if</span> (tip.Active) tip.Active = <span style="COLOR: blue">false</span>; <span style="COLOR: green">// Change the tooltip text</span> tip.SetToolTip(tree, toolTipText); <span style="COLOR: green">// Turn on the tooltip </span> tip.Active = <span style="COLOR: blue">true</span>; } </span></pre></fieldset> <br />

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p><a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/">VSLive Boston</a> in late June was fun. I spoke on 2 topics (one regarding the new features of <a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/06/15/64596.aspx">ADO.NET 2</a> and the other one regarding <a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/06/15/64595.aspx">System.Transactions</a>). I had a good time talking to several attendees at VSLive including a couple of our codebetter blog readers. One thing I love about presenting at conferences is that I get to meet really interesting and great people. </p>
<p>I just confirmed that I will also be presenting 2 different topics at <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/">VSLive Orlando</a>&nbsp;in October. You can check out the schedule of presentations for VSLive Orlando <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/agenda.aspx">here</a>. The topics and their brief summaries are below. Once I get the slides for these to a more completed state I will post their agendas as I did with the Boston ones <a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/06/15/64596.aspx">here </a>and <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/">here</a>. I'll be wearing my codebetter.com polo shirt, so track me down if you will be there too. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/sclive-sessions.aspx#efficientdata"><strong>Efficient Data Access with ADO.NET and SQL</strong><br /></a>Using an efficient data access strategy is essential in designing scalable and efficient enterprise solutions. In this session I will review several data access techniques that can improve performance and/or ease maintenance in applications. I’ll discuss efficient ways to implement ADO.NET database connections, automatic closure of connections and using connection pooling. I will also review some performance and efficiency tips when executing stored procedures, using parameterized queries, and preventing SQL injection attacks. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/asp-sessions.aspx#editingmaster"><strong>Editing Master and Detail Records in ASP.NET 2.0</strong></a> <br />The ASP.NET 2.0 GridView and DetailsView controls add tremendous value to developers who need to create editable web forms with master detail data. These controls reduce the amount of code required to page, sort and handle many events that formerly required custom event handlers. This session will demonstrate how to migrate code to these controls from the ASP.NET 1.x DataGrid in a mutli tier application. <br /></p>

  <h2>
    <a href="/all/2008/02/01/coderush-vs-resharper-round-2.html">CodeRush vs Resharper - Round 2</a>
  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>To add to <a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/10/23/133590.aspx">my last post on comparing Resharper and CodeRush</a>&nbsp;... I spent some more time with each of these products and something that stuck out right away was that they don;t play well together. I had several features run into each other (intellisense, templates, and keys that do different things) Yeah, I should have expected this and I guess deep down I did, but I was holding out hope that I could use both simultaneously. So I had to turn 1 off to truly test the other and then vice versa. It was a bit annoying that if I turned off <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">CodeRush </a>in the add-ins menu that it would unload, then reload. I had to close Visual Studio.NET to get it to stay unloaded. Like a telemarketer it just wouldn't stop getting in my face! I did not have this problem with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper </a>as once I unloaded it it stayed down. While this was annoying, I can't condemn the product for this, not if it turns out to be better for development (jury is still out in my mind as I give them both a fair shake).</p>
<p>Another thing that I noticed is that it takes about 1 minute to load my massive project into Visual Studio.NET&nbsp;when <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper&nbsp;</a>is running. It likely is loading&nbsp;all of its metadata,&nbsp;which&nbsp;caused&nbsp;my project to go from taking about 15 seconds to load to about 55 seconds.&nbsp;Not killer, but still an annoyance. <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">CodeRush </a>did not provide any noticeable delay to the loading of my project, which really stood out. But if I have to live with a delay at load time to gain the "Find Usages" and the "Analysis/Code Checking" features of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</a>, I'll take the good with the bad.</p>
<p>So far I haven't seen any compelling evidence (although there are some very useful features) that would cause me to use <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">CodeRush </a>over <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</a>. Although, I am still going to delve deeper into both to see what else there might be that I am missing. </p>
<p>If you have had experience comparing the 2 products, what did you find?</p>

    <p>I got back from <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/">VSLive Orlando</a>&nbsp;a few days ago - it was great! If you attended one of my presentations, I thank you and hope you enjoyed it/them. I had a great time talking to several attendees, speakers and the conference coordinators&nbsp;(they did a great job) at VSLive including. One thing I love about presenting at conferences is that I get to meet really interesting and great people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I presented 2 different topics this time (see the agenda <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/agenda.aspx">here</a>). For those of you looking for my code samples from my <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/asp-sessions.aspx#editingmaster">Editing Master and Detail Records in ASP.NET 2.0</a>&nbsp;session, you can download them from these 3 links:</p>
<ul> <li><a href="/blogs/john.papa/downloads/GridViewDemo%20procs.zip">Northwind Database Script for SQL Server 2005</a> <li><a href="/blogs/john.papa/downloads/GridViewDemo%20procs.zip">Additional Stored Procedures for the demo</a> <li><a href="/blogs/john.papa/downloads/GridViewDemo.zip">GridViewDemo code</a> (web site and class library projects)</li> <p>Note: I included the northwind database script for SQL Server 2005 since it is not shipped with the product. I think its great that we have new and more involved sample databases, but a lot of demos still work on Northwind, so it might come in handy for you.</p> <p>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Disclaimer: This code was written with VS.NET 2005's Release Candidate.</p> <p>Here is the abstract from this session:</p> <p><a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/or/asp-sessions.aspx#editingmaster">Editing Master and Detail Records in ASP.NET 2.0</a> <br />The ASP.NET 2.0 GridView and DetailsView controls add tremendous value to developers who need to create editable web forms with master detail data. These controls reduce the amount of code required to page, sort and handle many events that formerly required custom event handlers. This session will demonstrate how to migrate code to these controls from the ASP.NET 1.x DataGrid in a mutli tier application. The demos include examples on using the ObjectDataSource, SqlDataSource, Generics, the GridView, the DetailsView, Binding to Custom Business Objects, and Binding to ADO.NET DataTables.<br /></p>

The June 2005 release is compatible with Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0, but many of you are eagerly awaiting this next release of Enterprise Library which is specifically designed for .NET 2.0. In this webcast, we discuss how Enterprise Library has evolved to a true .NET 2.0 library.<br />&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>A while back I blogged about <a href="/blogs/john.papa/archive/2005/04/16/62098.aspx">my first impressions of BlogJet</a>. While I've been using <a href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a> on and off for a few&nbsp;months, I have unfortunatley put it back on my shelf. Don't get me wrong, it shows some real promise, but I had more issues with it not uploading images properly and sending some of my new posts into the netherworld. That is my biggest issue with BlogJet. I gave this a long hard look because I really wanted it to work. In any event, I will be sending some of my concerns to them as well as some of my future requests for features such as built in code formatting for code samples. (Currently I use a custom program I wrote as well as a program called <a href="http://www.jtleigh.com/CopySourceAsHtml/">CopySourceAsHtml</a>&nbsp;for formatting code.)</p>
<p>For now I am using an HTML editor and good old copy and paste. </p>
<p>NOTE: Brendan recently pointed out that it might be our server which is causing the uploading issues. So I apologize to the BlogJet software for any ill will :-) Seriously though, I still wish it had code formatting built in. How awesome would that be!</p>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I’ll be at <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/">VSLive in Boston</a> at the end of this month demonstrating coding techniques with ADO.NET 2, so please drop by and say hi if you get a chance. The session is titled <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/smart-sessions.aspx#getready">Get Ready for ADO.NET 2</a> and is at <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/agenda.aspx">5:45pm on June 29th</a>. Below is the synopsis of the session … and the agenda from my slide deck:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/bo/smart-sessions.aspx#getready"><strong>Get Ready for ADO.NET 2</strong></a></p>
<p>Data access using ADO.NET is at the core of most .NET enterprise applications. While ADO.NET 1.x is powerful, its successor ADO.NET 2 contains several new features that are can benefit an application. We'll review these new features and how to take advantage of them including binary serialization of DataSets, multiple active resultsets (MARS), and enhancements to strongly typed DataSets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p>
<ul> <li>Enhancements/Refinements, not a revolution <li>DataTable Enhancements <li>DataTableReader <li>Loading Data <li>LoadOption enumerator <li>Changing RowState <li>AcceptChangesOnUpdate <li>DataView enhancements <li>Batch Updates <li>Faster loading <li>Binary Serialization <li>Asynchronous commands </li>

  </h2>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>I've been doing some research on my next ADO.NET v2 book project so I've been reading several different ADO.NET v1 books trying to get a feel for what they did well, not so well, etc. I've read up a lot of reviews on these books which has helped me ge t feel for which ones did well. But I thought I would open the floor and ask ya'll what you look for in a book. What makes you take it off the shelf and, <strong>more importantly</strong>, read it end to end. Feel free to give your constructive opinions on what some of the existing ADO.NET v1 books out there did well and not so well, I know Sahil and I are both writing about ADO.NET and would love to hear some comments from ya'll. Thanks ahead of time!</p>
