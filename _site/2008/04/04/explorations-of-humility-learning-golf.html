<p>I've been an active athlete in several sports my whole life. I've played baseball, softball, football, soccer, volleyball and just about any other sport I can get into. By far the sport I enjoy the most and spend the most time in its thralls is soccer. I love playing soccer. Indoor, outdoor, 3v3, 7v7, 11v11, it really does not matter to me. I just love the game.  <p>Unfortunately age is catching up with me to a certain degree. The past year I had to take some time off from soccer due to an injury. I got antsy, real antsy not playing any contact sports of any kind. So I decided since I had some time on my hands I would take up golf. Hey, I am an athlete, in good shape, sports come pretty naturally to me ... I can handle golf! <p>Oh boy ... was I in for a lesson in humility.</p>
